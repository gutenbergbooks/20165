<p>Lines in the sample drawings are not always parallel. In some cases
this may be an artifact of the scanning process, but more often the
pictures were not positioned evenly in the original book. Page numbers
shown in brackets [&nbsp;] held illustrations without text. They will
sometimes be out of sequence with adjoining page numbers.</p>

<p>A few typographical errors have been corrected. They have been

<h4 class = "chapter">PREFACE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">It</span> is much easier to understand and
remember a thing when a reason is given for it, than when we are merely
shown how to do it without being told why it is so done; for in the
latter case, instead of being assisted by reason, our real help in all
study, we have to rely upon memory or our power of imitation, and to do
simply as we are told without thinking about it. The consequence is that
at the very first difficulty we are left to flounder about in the dark,
or to remain inactive till the master comes to our assistance.</p>

<p>Now in this book it is proposed to enlist the reasoning faculty from
the very first: to let one problem grow out of another and to be
dependent on the foregoing, as in geometry, and so to explain each thing
we do that there shall be no doubt in the mind as to the correctness of
the proceeding. The student will thus gain the power of finding out any
new problem for himself, and will therefore acquire a true knowledge of
perspective.</p>

<h4><a name = "necessity" id = "necessity">THE NECESSITY OF THE STUDY OF
PERSPECTIVE TO PAINTERS, SCULPTORS, AND ARCHITECTS</a></h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">Leonardo da Vinci</span> tells us in his
celebrated <i>Treatise on Painting</i> that the young artist should
first of all learn perspective, that is to say, he should first of all
learn that he has to depict on a flat surface objects which are in
relief or distant one from the other; for this is the simple art of
painting. Objects appear smaller at a distance than near to us, so by
drawing them thus we give depth to our canvas. The outline of a ball is
a mere flat circle, but with proper shading we make it appear round, and
this is the perspective of light and shade.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The next thing to be considered is the effect of the
atmosphere and light. If two figures are in the same coloured dress, and
are standing one behind the other, then they should be of slightly
different tone, so as to separate them. And in like manner, according to
the distance of the mountains in a landscape and the greater or less
density of the air, so do we depict space between them, not only making
them smaller in outline, but less distinct.&rsquo;<a class = "tag" name
= "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a></p>

<p>Sir Edwin Landseer used to say that in looking at a figure in a
picture he liked to feel that he could walk round it, and this exactly
expresses the impression that the true art of painting should make upon
the spectator.</p>

<p>There is another observation of Leonardo&rsquo;s that it is well I
should here transcribe; he says: &lsquo;Many are desirous of learning to
draw, and are very fond of it, who are notwithstanding void of a proper
disposition for it. This may be known by their want of perseverance;
like boys who draw everything in a hurry, never finishing or
shadowing.&rsquo; This shows they do not care for their work, and all
instruction is thrown away upon them. At the present time there is too
much of this &lsquo;everything in a hurry&rsquo;,
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
<!--png 015-->
and beginning in this way leads only to failure and disappointment.
These observations apply equally to perspective as to drawing and
painting.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this study is too often neglected by our painters,
some of them even complacently confessing their ignorance of it; while
the ordinary student either turns from it with distaste, or only endures
going through it with a view to passing an examination, little thinking
of what value it will be to him in working out his pictures. Whether the
manner of teaching perspective is the cause of this dislike for it,
I&nbsp;cannot say; but certainly most of our English books on the
subject are anything but attractive.</p>

<p>All the great masters of painting have also been masters of
perspective, for they knew that without it, it would be impossible to
carry out their grand compositions. In many cases they were even
inspired by it in choosing their subjects. When one looks at those sunny
interiors, those corridors and courtyards by De Hooghe, with their
figures far off and near, one feels that their charm consists greatly in
their perspective, as well as in their light and tone and colour. Or if
we study those Venetian masterpieces by Paul Veronese, Titian,
Tintoretto, and others, we become convinced that it was through their
knowledge of perspective that they gave such space and grandeur to their
canvases.</p>

<p>I need not name all the great artists who have shown their interest
and delight in this study, both by writing about it and practising it,
such as Albert DÃ¼rer and others, but I cannot leave out our own Turner,
who was one of the greatest masters in this respect that ever lived;
though in his case we can only judge of the results of his knowledge as
shown in his pictures, for although he was Professor of Perspective at
the Royal Academy in 1807&mdash;over a hundred years ago&mdash;and took
great pains with the diagrams he prepared to illustrate his lectures,
they seemed to the students to be full of confusion and obscurity; nor
am I aware that any record of them remains, although they must have
contained some valuable teaching, had their author possessed the art of
conveying&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>However, we are here chiefly concerned with the necessity of this
study, and of the necessity of starting our work with&nbsp;it.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">3</span>

<!--png 016-->
Before undertaking a large composition of figures, such as the
&lsquo;Wedding-feast at Cana&rsquo;, by Paul Veronese, or &lsquo;The
School of Athens&rsquo;, by Raphael, the artist should set out his
floors, his walls, his colonnades, his balconies, his steps, &amp;c., so
that he may know where to place his personages, and to measure their
different sizes according to their distances; indeed, he must make his
stage and his scenery before he introduces his actors. He can then
proceed with his composition, arrange his groups and the accessories
with ease, and above all with correctness. But I have noticed that some
of our cleverest painters will arrange their figures to please the eye,
and when fairly advanced with their work will call in an expert, to (as
they call it) put in their perspective for them, but as it does not form
part of their original composition, it involves all sorts of
difficulties and vexatious alterings and rubbings out, and even then is
not always satisfactory. For the expert may not be an artist, nor in
sympathy with the picture, hence there will be a want of unity in it;
whereas the whole thing, to be in harmony, should be the conception of
one mind, and the perspective as much a part of the composition as the
figures.</p>

<p>If a ceiling has to be painted with figures floating or flying in the
air, or sitting high above us, then our perspective must take a
different form, and the point of sight will be above our heads instead
of on the horizon; nor can these difficulties be overcome without an
adequate knowledge of the science, which will enable us to work out for
ourselves any new problems of this kind that we may have to solve.</p>

<p>Then again, with a view to giving different effects or impressions in
this decorative work, we must know where to place the horizon and the
points of sight, for several of the latter are sometimes required when
dealing with large surfaces such as the painting of walls, or stage
scenery, or panoramas depicted on a cylindrical canvas and viewed from
the centre thereof, where a fresh point of sight is required at every
twelve or sixteen feet.</p>

<p>Without a true knowledge of perspective, none of these things can be
done. The artist should study them in the great compositions of the
masters, by analysing their pictures and seeing
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
<!--png 017-->
how and for what reasons they applied their knowledge. Rubens put low
horizons to most of his large figure-subjects, as in &lsquo;The Descent
from the Cross&rsquo;, which not only gave grandeur to his designs, but,
seeing they were to be placed above the eye, gave a more natural
appearance to his figures. The Venetians often put the horizon almost on
a level with the base of the picture or edge of the frame, and sometimes
even below it; as in &lsquo;The Family of Darius at the Feet of
Alexander&rsquo;, by Paul Veronese, and &lsquo;The Origin of the
&ldquo;Via Lactea&rdquo;&rsquo;, by Tintoretto, both in our National
Gallery. But in order to do all these things, the artist in designing
his work must have the knowledge of perspective at his fingers' ends,
and only the details, which are often tedious, should he leave to an
assistant to work out for him.</p>

<p>We must remember that the line of the horizon should be as nearly as
possible on a level with the eye, as it is in nature; and yet one of the
commonest mistakes in our exhibitions is the bad placing of this line.
We see dozens of examples of it, where in full-length portraits and
other large pictures intended to be seen from below, the horizon is
placed high up in the canvas instead of low down; the consequence is
that compositions so treated not only lose in grandeur and truth, but
appear to be toppling over, or give the impression of smallness rather
than bigness. Indeed, they look like small pictures enlarged, which is a
very different thing from a large design. So that, in order to see them
properly, we should mount a ladder to get upon a level with their
horizon line (see <a href = "#fig66">Fig. 66</a>, double-page
illustration).</p>

<p>We have here spoken in a general way of the importance of this study
to painters, but we shall see that it is of almost equal importance to
the sculptor and the architect.</p>

<p>A sculptor student at the Academy, who was making his drawings rather
carelessly, asked me of what use perspective was to a sculptor.
&lsquo;In the first place,&rsquo; I&nbsp;said, &lsquo;to reason out
apparently difficult problems, and to find how easy they become, will
improve your mind; and in the second, if you have to do monumental work,
it will teach you the exact size to make your figures according to the
height they are to be placed, and also the boldness with which they
should be treated to give them their full effect.&rsquo;

He at once acknowledged that I was right, proved himself an efficient
pupil, and took much interest in his work.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking that the reason our public monuments so often
fail to impress us with any sense of grandeur is in a great measure
owing to the neglect of the scientific study of perspective. As an
illustration of what I mean, let the student look at a good engraving or
photograph of the Arch of Constantine at Rome, or the Tombs of the
Medici, by Michelangelo, in the sacristy of San Lorenzo at Florence. And
then, for an example of a mistake in the placing of a colossal figure,
let him turn to the Tomb of Julius II in San Pietro in Vinculis, Rome,
and he will see that the figure of Moses, so grand in itself, not only
loses much of its dignity by being placed on the ground instead of in
the niche above it, but throws all the other figures out of proportion
or harmony, and was quite contrary to Michelangelo&rsquo;s intention.
Indeed, this tomb, which was to have been the finest thing of its kind
ever done, was really the tragedy of the great sculptor&rsquo;s
life.</p>

<p>The same remarks apply in a great measure to the architect as to the
sculptor. The old builders knew the value of a knowledge of perspective,
and, as in the case of Serlio, Vignola, and others, prefaced their
treatises on architecture with chapters on geometry and perspective. For
it showed them how to give proper proportions to their buildings and the
details thereof; how to give height and importance both to the interior
and exterior; also to give the right sizes of windows, doorways,
columns, vaults, and other parts, and the various heights they should
make their towers, walls, arches, roofs, and so forth. One of the most
beautiful examples of the application of this knowledge to architecture
is the Campanile of the Cathedral, at Florence, built by Giotto and
Taddeo Gaddi, who were painters as well as architects. Here it will be
seen that the height of the windows is increased as they are placed
higher up in the building, and the top windows or openings into the
belfry are about six times the size of those in the lower story.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Perspective</span> is a subtle form of
geometry; it represents figures and objects not as they are but as we
see them in space, whereas geometry represents figures not as we see
them but as they are. When we have a front view of a figure such as a
square, its perspective and geometrical appearance is the same, and we
see it as it really is, that is, with all its sides equal and all its
angles right angles, the perspective only varying in size according to
the distance we are from it; but if we place that square flat on the
table and look at it sideways or at an angle, then we become conscious
of certain changes in its form&mdash;the side farthest from us appears
shorter than that near to us,
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>

and all the angles are different. Thus <span class =

<p>The science of perspective gives the dimensions of objects seen in
space as they appear to the eye of the spectator, just as a perfect
tracing of those objects on a sheet of glass placed vertically between
him and them would do; indeed its very name is derived from
<i>perspicere</i>, to see through. But as no tracing done by hand could
possibly be mathematically correct, the mathematician teaches us how by
certain points and measurements we may yet give a perfect image of them.
These images are called projections, but the artist calls them pictures.
In this sketch <span class = "smallroman">K</span> is the vertical
transparent plane or picture, <span class = "smallroman">O</span> is a
cube placed on one side of it. The young student is the spectator on the
other side of it, the dotted lines drawn from the corners of the cube to
the eye of the spectator are the visual rays, and the points on the
transparent picture plane where these visual rays pass through it
indicate the perspective position
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>

of those points on the picture. To find these points is the main object
or duty of linear perspective.</p>

<p>Perspective up to a certain point is a pure science, not depending
upon the accidents of vision, but upon the exact laws of reasoning. Nor
is it to be considered as only pertaining to the craft of the painter
and draughtsman. It has an intimate connexion with our mental
perceptions and with the ideas that are impressed upon the brain by the
appearance of all that surrounds us. If we saw everything as depicted by
plane geometry, that is, as a map, we should have no difference of view,
no variety of ideas, and we should live in a world of unbearable
monotony; but as we see everything in perspective, which is infinite in
its variety of aspect, our minds are subjected to countless phases of
thought, making the world around us constantly interesting, so it is
devised that we shall see the infinite wherever we turn, and marvel at
it, and delight in it, although perhaps in many cases unconsciously.</p>

<p>In perspective, as in geometry, we deal with parallels, squares,
triangles, cubes, circles, &amp;c.; but in perspective the same figure
takes an endless variety of forms, whereas in geometry it has but one.
Here are three equal geometrical squares: they are all alike. Here are
three equal perspective squares, but all varied
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
<!--png 022-->
in form; and the same figure changes in aspect as often as we view it
from a different position. A&nbsp;walk round the dining-room table will
exemplify this.</p>

<p>It is in proving that, notwithstanding this difference of appearance,
the figures do represent the same form, that much of our work consists;
and for those who care to exercise their reasoning powers it becomes not
only a sure means of knowledge, but a study of the greatest
interest.</p>

<p>Perspective is said to have been formed into a science about the
fifteenth century. Among the names mentioned by the unknown but pleasant
author of <i>The Practice of Perspective</i>, written by a Jesuit of
Paris in the eighteenth century, we find Albert DÃ¼rer, who has left us
some rules and principles in the fourth book of his <i>Geometry</i>;
Jean Cousin, who has an express treatise on the art wherein are many
valuable things; also Vignola, who altered the plans of St.
Peter&rsquo;s left by Michelangelo; Serlio, whose treatise is one of the
best I have seen of these early writers; Du Cerceau, Serigati, Solomon
de Cause, Marolois, Vredemont; Guidus Ubaldus, who first introduced
foreshortening; the Sieur de Vaulizard, the Sieur Dufarges, Joshua
Kirby, for whose <i>Method of Perspective made Easy</i> <ins class =
"correction" title = "question mark in original">(?)</ins> Hogarth drew
the well-known frontispiece; and lastly, the above-named <i>Practice of
Perspective</i> by a Jesuit of Paris, which is very clear and excellent
as far as it goes, and was the book used by Sir Joshua Reynolds.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a> But nearly all
these authors treat chiefly of parallel perspective, which they do with
clearness and simplicity, and also mathematically, as shown in the short
treatise in Latin by Christian Wolff, but they scarcely touch upon the
more difficult problems of angular and oblique perspective. Of modern
books, those to which I am most indebted are the <i>TraitÃ© Pratique de
Perspective</i> of M.&nbsp;A. Cassagne (Paris, 1873), which is
thoroughly artistic, and full of pictorial examples admirably done; and
to M.&nbsp;Henriet&rsquo;s <i>Cours Rational de Dessin</i>. There are
many other foreign books of excellence, notably M.&nbsp;Thibault's
<i>Perspective</i>, and some German and Swiss books, and yet,
notwithstanding this imposing array of authors, I&nbsp;venture to say
that many new features and original
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
<!--png 023-->
problems are presented in this book, whilst the old ones are not
neglected. As, for instance, How to draw figures at an angle without
vanishing points (see p.&nbsp;141, <a href = "#fig162">Fig. 162</a>,
&amp;c.), a&nbsp;new method of angular perspective which dispenses with
the cumbersome setting out usually adopted, and enables us to draw
figures at any angle without vanishing lines, &amp;c., and is almost, if
not quite, as simple as parallel perspective (see p.&nbsp;133, <a href =
"#fig150">Fig. 150</a>, &amp;c.). How to measure distances by the square
and diagonal, and to draw interiors thereby (p.&nbsp;128, <a href =
"#fig144">Fig. 144</a>). How to explain the theory of perspective by
ocular demonstration, using a vertical sheet of glass with strings,
placed on a drawing-board, which I have found of the greatest use (see
p.&nbsp;29, <a href = "#fig29">Fig. 29</a>). Then again, I&nbsp;show how
all our perspective can be done inside the picture; that we can measure
any distance into the picture from a foot to a mile or twenty miles (see
p.&nbsp;86, <a href = "#fig94">Fig. 94</a>); how we can draw the Great
Pyramid, which stands on thirteen acres of ground, by putting it 1,600
feet off (<a href = "#fig224">Fig. 224</a>), &amp;c., &amp;c. And while
preserving the mathematical science, so that all our operations can be
proved to be correct, my chief aim has been to make it easy of
application to our work and consequently useful to the artist.</p>

<p>The Egyptians do not appear to have made any use of linear
perspective. Perhaps it was considered out of character with their
particular kind of decoration, which is to be looked upon as picture
writing rather than pictorial art; a&nbsp;table, for instance, would be
represented like a ground-plan and the objects upon it in elevation or
standing up. A&nbsp;row of chariots with their horses and drivers side
by side were placed one over the other, and although the Egyptians had
no doubt a reason for this kind of representation, for they were grand
artists, it seems to us very primitive; and indeed quite young beginners
who have never drawn from real objects have a tendency to do very much
the same thing as this ancient people did, or even to emulate the
mathematician and represent things not as they appear but as they are,
and will make the top of a table an almost upright square and the
objects upon it as if they would fall off.</p>

<p>No doubt the Greeks had correct notions of perspective, for the
paintings on vases, and at Pompeii and Herculaneum, which were either by
Greek artists or copied from Greek pictures,
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
<!--png 024-->
show some knowledge, though not complete knowledge, of this science.
Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any great artist making his
perspective very wrong, for if he can draw the human figure as the
Greeks did, surely he can draw an angle.</p>

<p>The Japanese, who are great observers of nature, seem to have got at
their perspective by copying what they saw, and, although they are not
quite correct in a few things, they convey the idea of distance and make
their horizontal planes look level, which are two important things in
perspective. Some of their landscapes are beautiful; their trees,
flowers, and foliage exquisitely drawn and arranged with the greatest
taste; whilst there is a character and go about their figures and birds,
&amp;c., that can hardly be surpassed. All their pictures are lively and
intelligent and appear to be executed with ease, which shows their
authors to be complete masters of their craft.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the Chinese, although their perspective is
more decorative than true, and whilst their taste is exquisite their
whole art is much more conventional and traditional, and does not remind
us of nature like that of the Japanese.</p>

<p>We may see defects in the perspective of the ancients, in the
mediaeval painters, in the Japanese and Chinese, but are we always right
ourselves? Even in celebrated pictures by old and modern masters there
are occasionally errors that might easily have been avoided, if a ready
means of settling the difficulty were at hand. We should endeavour then
to make this study as simple, as easy, and as complete as possible, to
show clear evidence of its correctness (according to its conditions),
and at the same time to serve as a guide on any and all occasions that
we may require&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>To illustrate what is perspective, and as an experiment that any one
can make, whether artist or not, let us stand at a window that looks out
on to a courtyard or a street or a garden, &amp;c., and trace with a
paint-brush charged with Indian ink or water-colour the outline of
whatever view there happens to be outside, being careful to keep the eye
always in the same place by means of a rest; when this is dry, place a
piece of drawing-paper over it and trace through with a pencil. Now we
will rub out the tracing on the glass, which is sure to be rather
clumsy, and, fixing
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
<!--png 025-->
our paper down on a board, proceed to draw the scene before us, using
the main lines of our tracing as our guiding lines.</p>

<p>If we take pains over our work, we shall find that, without troubling
ourselves much about rules, we have produced a perfect perspective of
perhaps a very difficult subject. After practising for some little time
in this way we shall get accustomed to what are called perspective
deformations, and soon be able to dispense with the glass and the
tracing altogether and to sketch straight from nature, taking little
note of perspective beyond fixing the point of sight and the
horizontal-line; in fact, doing what every artist does when he goes out
sketching.</p>

roundness is infinitesimal.</p>

<p>There are three things to be considered and understood before we can
begin a perspective drawing. First, the position of the eye in front of
the picture, which is called the <b>Station-point</b>, and of course is
not in the picture itself, but its position is indicated by a point on
the picture which is exactly opposite the eye of the spectator, and is
called the <b>Point of Sight</b>, or <b>Principal Point</b>, or
<b>Centre of Vision</b>, but we will keep to the first of these.</p>

<p>If our picture plane is a sheet of glass, and is so placed that we
can see the landscape behind it or a sea-view, we shall find that the
distant line of the horizon passes through that point of sight, and we
therefore draw a line on our picture which exactly corresponds with it,
and which we call the <b>Horizontal-line</b> or <b>Horizon</b>.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag3" id = "tag3" href = "#note3">3</a> The height of
the horizon then depends entirely upon the position of the eye of the
spectator: if he rises, so does the horizon; if he stoops or descends to
lower ground, so does the horizon follow his movements. You may sit in a
boat on a calm sea, and the horizon will be as low down as you are, or
you may go to the top of a high cliff, and still the horizon will be on
the same level as your eye.</p>

<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
<!--png 029-->
This is an important line for the draughtsman to consider, for the
effect of his picture greatly depends upon the position of the horizon.
If you wish to give height and dignity to a mountain or a building, the
horizon should be low down, so that these things may appear to tower
above you. If you wish to show a wide expanse of landscape, then you
must survey it from a height. In a composition of figures, you select
your horizon according to the subject, and with a view to help the
grouping. Again, in portraits and decorative work to be placed high up,
a&nbsp;low horizon is desirable, but I have already spoken of this
subject in the chapter on the necessity of the study of perspective.</p>

<p>Fig. 11. The distance of the spectator from the picture is of great
importance; as the distortions and disproportions arising from too near
a view are to be avoided, the object of drawing being to make things
look natural; thus, the floor should look level, and not as if it were
running up hill&mdash;the top of a table flat, and not on a slant, as if
cups and what not, placed upon it, would fall off.</p>

<p>In this figure we have a geometrical or ground plan of two squares at
different distances from the picture, which is represented by the line
<span class = "smallroman">KK</span>. The spectator is first at <span
class = "smallroman">A</span>, the corner of the near square <span class
= "smallroman">A</span><i>cd</i>. If from <span class =

to the line <span class = "smallroman">KK</span> (which may represent
the horizontal-line in the picture), where it intersects that line at
<span class = "smallroman">AÂ·</span> marks the distance that the
spectator is from the point of sight <span class =

diagonal <span class = "smallroman">BBÂ´</span>, so that all lines or
diagonals at 45Â° are drawn to the point of distance (see
Rule&nbsp;6).</p>

the effect of the short-distance point <span class =

<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
<!--png 030-->
right point of distance: if we take it too near the point of sight, as
in Fig. 12, the square looks unnatural and distorted. This, I&nbsp;may
note, is a common fault with photographs taken with a wide-angle lens,
which throws everything out of proportion, and will make the east end of
a church or a cathedral appear higher than the steeple or tower; but as
soon as we make our

<p>In some books on perspective we are told to make the angle of vision
60Â°, so that the distance <span class = "smallroman">SD</span> (Fig. 14)
is to be rather less than the length or height of the picture, as at
<span class = "smallroman">A</span>. The French recommend an angle of
28Â°, and to make the distance about double the length of the picture, as
at <span class = "smallroman">B</span> (Fig. 15), which is far more
agreeable. For we must remember that the distance-point is not only the
point from which we are supposed to make our tracing on the vertical
transparent plane, or a point transferred to the horizon to make our
measurements by, but it is also the point in front of the canvas that we
view the picture from, called the station-point. It is ridiculous, then,
to have it so close that we must almost touch the canvas with our noses
before we can see its perspective properly.</p>

<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>

view it, even across the room or gallery, and of course in decorative
work and in scene-painting a long distance is necessary.</p>

<p>We need not, however, tie ourselves down to any hard and fast rule,
but should choose our distance according to the impression of space we
wish to convey: if we have to represent a domestic scene in a small
room, as in many Dutch pictures, we must not make our distance-point too
far off, as it would exaggerate the size of the room.</p>

The height of the horizon is also an important consideration in the
composition of a picture, and so also is the position of the point of
sight, as we shall see farther&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>In landscape and cattle pictures a low horizon often gives space and
air, as in this sketch from a picture by Paul Potter&mdash;where the
horizontal-line is placed at one quarter the height of the canvas.
Indeed, a&nbsp;judicious use of the laws of perspective is a great aid
to composition, and no picture ever looks right unless these laws are
attended to. At the present time too little attention is paid to them;
the consequence is that much of the art of the day reflects in a great
measure the monotony of the snap-shot camera, with its everyday and
wearisome commonplace.</p>

<p>We perceive objects by means of the visual rays, which are imaginary
straight lines drawn from the eye to the various points of the thing we
are looking at. As those rays proceed from the pupil of the eye, which
is a circular opening, they form themselves into a cone called the
<b>Optic Cone</b>, the base of which increases in proportion to its
distance from the eye, so that the larger the view which we wish to take
in, the farther must we be removed from it. The diameter of the base of
this cone, with the visual rays drawn from each of its extremities to
the eye, form the angle of vision, which is wider or narrower according
to the distance of this diameter.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose a visual ray <span class = "smallroman">EA</span>
to be directed to some small object on the floor, say the head of a
nail, <span class = "smallroman">A</span> (Fig. 17). If we interpose
between this nail and our eye a sheet of glass, <span class =
"smallroman">K</span>, placed vertically on the floor, we continue to
see the nail through the glass, and it is easily understood that its
perspective appearance thereon is the point <i>a</i>, where the visual
ray passes through it. If now we trace on the floor a line <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> from the nail to the spot <span class =
"smallroman">B</span>, just under the eye, and from the point <i>o</i>,
where this line passes through or under the glass, we raise a
perpendicular <i>o</i><span class = "smallroman">S</span>, that
perpendicular passes through the precise point that the visual ray
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>

passes through. The line <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> traced on
the floor is the horizontal trace of the visual ray, and it will be seen
that the point <i>a</i> is situated on the vertical raised from this
horizontal trace.</p>

&amp;c., we drop perpendiculars from different points of those lines on

original line. We may liken these projections to sun-shadows when the

represent the length of the original line, but only so much of it as

a vertical plane, but in that case we draw lines parallel to the
horizontal plane, and by this means we can get the position of a point
in space; and by the assistance of perspective, as will be shown farther
on, we can carry out the most difficult propositions of descriptive
geometry and of the geometry of planes and solids.</p>

VII</a></h5>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">The Rules and Conditions of Perspective</h5>


<p>The conditions of linear perspective are somewhat rigid. In the first
place, we are supposed to look at objects with one eye only; that is,
the visual rays are drawn from a single point, and not from two. Of this
we shall speak later on. Then again, the eye must be placed in a certain
position, as at <span class = "smallroman">E</span> (Fig. 22), at a
given height from the ground, <span class = "smallroman">SÂ·E</span>, and
at a given distance from the picture, as <span class =
"smallroman">SE</span>. In the next place, the picture or picture plane
itself must be vertical and perpendicular to the ground or horizontal
plane, which plane is supposed to be as level as a billiard-table, and
to extend from the base line, <i>ef</i>, of the picture to the horizon,
that is, to infinity, for it does not partake of the rotundity of the
earth.</p>

<p>We can only work out our propositions and figures in space with
mathematical precision by adopting such conditions as the above. But
afterwards the artist or draughtsman may modify and suit them to a more
elastic view of things; that is, he can make his figures separate from
one another, instead of their outlines coming close together as they do
when we look at them
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
<!--png 038-->
with only one eye. Also he will allow for the unevenness of the ground
and the roundness of our globe; he may even move his head and his eyes,
and use both of them, and in fact make himself quite at his ease when he
is out sketching, for Nature does all his perspective for him. At the
same time, a&nbsp;knowledge of this rigid perspective is the sure and
unerring basis of his freehand drawing.</p>

<p>Vertical lines remain vertical in perspective, and are divided in the

<p>It is not an uncommon error to suppose that the vertical lines of a
high building should converge towards the top; so they would if we stood
at the foot of that building and looked up, for then we should alter the
conditions of our perspective, and our point of sight, instead of being
on the horizon, would be up in the sky. But if we stood sufficiently far
away, so as to bring the whole of the building within our angle of
vision, and the point of sight down to the horizon, then these same
lines would appear perfectly parallel, and the different stories in
their true proportion.</p>

<p>Horizontals parallel to the base of the picture are also parallel to
that base in the picture. Thus <i>aÂ·bÂ·</i> (Fig. 25) is parallel to
<span class = "smallroman">AB</span>,
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>

and to <span class = "smallroman">GL</span>, the base of the picture.
Indeed, the same argument may be used with regard to horizontal lines as
with verticals. If we look at a straight wall in front of us, its top
and its rows of bricks, &amp;c., are parallel and horizontal; but if we
look along it sideways, then we alter the conditions, and the parallel
lines converge to whichever point we direct the eye.</p>

<p>This rule is important, as we shall see when we come to the
consideration of the perspective vanishing scale. Its use may be
illustrated by this sketch, where the houses, walls, &amp;c., are
parallel to the base of the picture. When that is the case, then objects
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
<!--png 041-->
exactly facing us, such as windows, doors, rows of boards, or of bricks
or palings, &amp;c., are drawn with their horizontal lines parallel to
the base; hence it is called parallel perspective.</p>

<p>All lines situated in a plane that is parallel to the picture plane
diminish in proportion as they become more distant, but do not undergo
any perspective deformation; and remain in the same relation and
proportion each to each as the original lines. This is called the front
view.</p>

<p>An arrangement such as there indicated is the best means of
illustrating this rule. But instead of tracing the outline of the square
or cube on the glass, as there shown, I&nbsp;have a hole drilled through
at the point <span class = "smallroman">S</span> (Fig. 29), which I
select for the point of sight, and through which I pass two loose
strings <span class = "smallroman">A</span> and <span class =
"smallroman">B</span>, fixing their ends at <span class =
"smallroman">S</span>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
<!--png 042-->

<p>As <span class = "smallroman">SD</span> represents the distance the
spectator is from the glass or picture, I&nbsp;make string <span class =
"smallroman">SA</span> equal in length to <span class =
"smallroman">SD</span>. Now if the pupil takes this string in one hand
and holds it at right angles to the glass, that is, exactly in front of
<span class = "smallroman">S</span>, and then places one eye at the end
<span class = "smallroman">A</span> (of course with the string
extended), he will be at the proper distance from the picture. Let him
then take the other string, <span class = "smallroman">SB</span>, in the
other hand, and apply it to point <i>bÂ´</i> where the square touches the
glass, and he will find that it exactly tallies with the side <i>bÂ´f</i>
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
<!--png 043-->
of the square <i>aÂ·bÂ´fe</i>. If he applies the same string to <i>aÂ·</i>,
the other corner of the square, his string will exactly tally or cover
the side <i>aÂ·e</i>, and he will thus have ocular demonstration of this
important rule.</p>

<p>In this little picture (Fig. 30) in parallel perspective it will be
seen that the lines which retreat from us at right angles to the picture
plane are directed to the point of sight <span class =

<h5 class = "smallcaps"><a name = "rule6" id = "rule6">Rule 6</a></h5>

<p>All horizontals which are at 45Â°, or half a right angle to the
picture plane, are drawn to the point of distance.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the diagonal of the perspective square, if
produced to meet the horizon on the picture, will mark on that horizon
the distance that the spectator is from the point of sight (see <a href
= "#chapIII">definition</a>, p.&nbsp;16). This point of distance becomes
then the measuring point for all horizontals at right angles to the
picture plane.</p>

Thus in Fig. 31 lines <span class = "smallroman">AS</span> and <span
class = "smallroman">BS</span> are drawn to the point of sight <span
class = "smallroman">S</span>, and are therefore at right angles to the
base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>. <span class =
"smallroman">AD</span> being drawn to <span class =
"smallroman">D</span> (the distance-point), is at an angle of 45Â° to the
base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>, and <span class =
"smallroman">AC</span> is therefore the diagonal of a square. The line
1<span class = "smallroman">C</span> is made parallel to <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, consequently <span class =
"smallroman">A</span>1<span class = "smallroman">CB</span> is a square
in perspective. The line <span class = "smallroman">BC</span>,
therefore, being one side of that square, is equal to <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, another side of it. So that to measure a length
on a line drawn to the point of sight, such as <span class =
"smallroman">BS</span>, we set out the length required, say <span class
= "smallroman">BA</span>, on the base-line, then from <span class =
"smallroman">A</span> draw a line to the point of distance, and where it
cuts <span class = "smallroman">BS</span> at <span class =
"smallroman">C</span> is the length required. This can be repeated any
number of times, say five, so that in this figure <span class =
"smallroman">BE</span> is five times the length of <span class =

<p>All horizontals forming any other angles but the above are drawn to

will be seen that the line <span class = "smallroman">BVÂ´</span> is at a
greater angle to the base than <span class = "smallroman">BD</span>; it
is therefore drawn to a point <span class = "smallroman">VÂ´</span>,
within the point of distance and nearer to the point of sight <span

drawn to a point some way beyond the other distance point.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;When this vanishing point is a long way outside
the picture, the architects make use of a centrolinead, and the painters
fix a long string at the required point, and get their perspective lines
by that means, which is very inconvenient. But I will show you later on

<p>The farther a point is removed from the picture plane the nearer does
its perspective appearance approach the horizontal line so long as it is
viewed from the same position. On the contrary, if the spectator
retreats from the picture plane <span class = "smallroman">K</span>
(which we suppose to be transparent), the point remaining at the same
place, the perspective appearance of this point will approach the
ground-line in proportion to the distance of the spectator.</p>

<p>Horizontals in the same plane which are drawn to the same point on

Fig. 40.</p>

<p>This is a very important rule, for all our perspective drawing
depends upon it. When we say that parallels are drawn to the same point
on the horizon it does not imply that they meet at that point, which
would be a contradiction; perspective parallels never reach that point,
although they appear to do so. Fig. 40 will explain this.</p>

<p>Suppose <span class = "smallroman">S</span> to be the spectator,
<span class = "smallroman">AB</span> a transparent vertical plane which
represents the picture seen edgeways, and <span class =
"smallroman">HS</span> and <span class = "smallroman">DC</span> two
parallel lines, mark off spaces between these parallels equal to <span
class = "smallroman">SC</span>, the height of the eye of the spectator,
and raise verticals 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c., forming so many squares.
Vertical line&nbsp;2 viewed from <span class = "smallroman">S</span>
will appear on <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> but half its length,
vertical&nbsp;3 will be only a third, vertical&nbsp;4 a fourth, and so
on, and if we multiplied these spaces <i>ad infinitum</i> we must keep
on dividing the line <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> by the same
number. So if we suppose <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> to be a
yard high and the distance from one vertical to another to be also a
yard, then if one of these were a thousand yards away its representation
at <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> would be the thousandth part of
a yard, or ten thousand yards away, its representation at <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> would be the ten-thousandth part, and whatever
the distance it must always be something; and therefore <span class =
"smallroman">HS</span> and <span class = "smallroman">DC</span>, however
far they may be produced
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>

and however close they may appear to get, can never meet.</p>

<p>Fig. 41 is a perspective view of the same figure&mdash;but more
extended. It will be seen that a line drawn from the tenth upright <span
class = "smallroman">K</span> to <span class = "smallroman">S</span>
cuts off a tenth of <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>. We look then
upon these two lines <span class = "smallroman">SP, OP</span>, as the
sides of a long parallelogram of which <span class =
"smallroman">SK</span> is the diagonal, as <i>cefd</i>, the figure on
the ground, is also a parallelogram.</p>

<p>The student can obtain for himself a further illustration of this

then sketching himself and his surroundings as seen therein.

He will find that all the horizontals at right angles to the glass will
converge to his own eye. This rule applies equally to lines which are at
an angle to the picture plane as to those that are at right angles or
perpendicular to it, as in Rule&nbsp;7. It also applies to those on an
inclined plane, as in Rule&nbsp;8.</p>

With the above rules and a clear notion of the definitions and
conditions of perspective, we should be able to work out any proposition
or any new figure that may present itself. At any rate, a&nbsp;thorough
understanding of these few pages will make the labour now before us
simple and easy. I&nbsp;hope, too, it may be found interesting. There is
always a certain pleasure in deceiving and being deceived by the senses,
and in optical and other illusions, such as making things appear far off
that are quite near, in making a picture of an object on a flat surface
to look as if it stood out and in relief by a kind of magic. But there
is, I&nbsp;think, a&nbsp;still greater pleasure than this, namely, in
invention and in overcoming difficulties&mdash;in finding out how to do
things for ourselves by our reasoning faculties, in originating or being
original, as it were. Let us now see how far we can go in this
respect.</p>

<p>From a given point on the base line of the picture draw a line at
right angles to that base. Let <span class = "smallroman">P</span> be
the given point on the base line <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>,
and <span class = "smallroman">S</span> the point of sight. We simply
draw a line along the ground to the point of sight <span class =
"smallroman">S</span>, and this line will be at right angles to the
base, as explained in Rule&nbsp;5, and consequently angle <span class =
"smallroman">APS</span> will be equal to angle <span class =

<p>We have here proceeded in much the same way as in drawing a
geometrical square (Fig. 47), by drawing two lines <span class =
"smallroman">AE</span> and <span class = "smallroman">BC</span> at right
angles to a given line, <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>, and from
<span class = "smallroman">A</span>, drawing the diagonal <span class =
"smallroman">AC</span> at 45Â° till it cuts <span class =
"smallroman">BC</span> at <span class = "smallroman">C</span>, and then
through <span class = "smallroman">C</span> drawing <span class =
"smallroman">EC</span> parallel to <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>.
Let it be remarked that because the two perspective lines (Fig. 48)
<span class = "smallroman">AS</span> and <span class =
"smallroman">BS</span> are at right angles to the base, they must
consequently be parallel to each other, and therefore are perspectively
equidistant, so that all lines parallel to <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> and lying between them, such as <i>ad</i>,
<i>cf</i>, &amp;c., must be equal.</p>

<p>So likewise all diagonals drawn to the point of distance, which
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
<!--png 058-->
are contained between these parallels, such as <span class =
"smallroman">A</span><i>d</i>, <i>af</i>, &amp;c., must be equal. For
all straight lines which meet at any point on the horizon are
perspectively parallel to each other, just as two geometrical parallels
crossing two others at any angle, as at Fig. 49. Note also (Fig. 48)
that all squares formed between the two vanishing lines <span class =
"smallroman">AS</span>, <span class = "smallroman">BS</span>, and by the
aid of these diagonals, are also equal, and further, that any number of
squares such as are shown in this figure (Fig. 50), formed in the same
way and having equal bases, are also equal; and the nine squares
contained in the square <i>abcd</i> being equal, they divide each side
of the larger square into three equal parts.</p>

<p>From this we learn how we can measure any number of given
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
<!--png 059-->
lengths, either equal or unequal, on a vanishing or retreating line
which is at right angles to the base; and also how we can measure any
width or number of widths on a line such as <i>dc</i>, that is, parallel
to the base of the picture, however remote it may be from that base.</p>

<p>Of course when we speak of <b>Perpendiculars</b> we do not mean
verticals only, but straight lines at right angles to other lines in any
position. Also in speaking of <b>lines</b> a right or <b>straight
line</b> is to be understood; or when we speak of <b>horizontals</b> we
mean all straight lines that are parallel to the perspective plane, such
as those on Fig. 52, no matter what direction they take so long as they
are level. They are not to be confused with the horizon or
horizontal-line.</p>

<p>There are one or two other terms used in perspective which are not
satisfactory because they are confusing, such as vanishing lines and
vanishing points. The French term, <i>fuyante</i> or <i>lignes
fuyantes</i>, or going-away lines, is more expressive; and <i>point de
fuite</i>, instead of vanishing point, is much better. I&nbsp;have
occasionally called the former retreating lines, but the simple meaning
is, lines that are not parallel to the picture plane; but a vanishing
line implies a line that disappears, and a vanishing point implies
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
<!--png 062-->
a point that gradually goes out of sight. Still, it is difficult to

as at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, they would also be equal; but as the angle
<i>b</i> at which the upper one is seen is smaller than angle <i>a</i>,
at which the lower figure or statue is seen, it will appear smaller to
the spectator (<span class = "smallroman">S</span>) both in reality and
in the picture.</p>

<p>But if we wish them to appear the same size to the spectator who is
viewing them from below, we must make the angles <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
(Fig. 64), at which they are viewed, both equal. Then draw lines through
equal arcs, as at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, till they cut the vertical
<span class = "smallroman">NO</span> (representing the side of the
building where the figures are to be placed). We shall then obtain the
exact size of the figure at that height, which will make it look the
same size as the lower one, <span class = "smallroman">N</span>. The
same rule applies to the picture <span class = "smallroman">K</span>,
when it is of large proportions. As an example in painting, take
Michelangelo&rsquo;s large altar-piece in the Sistine Chapel, &lsquo;The
Last Judgement&rsquo;; here the figures forming the upper group, with
our Lord in judgement surrounded by saints, are about four times the
size, that is, about twice the height, of those at the lower part of the
fresco. The
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
<!--png 071-->
figures on the ceiling of the same chapel are studied not only according
to their height from the pavement, which is 60 ft., but to suit the
arched form of it. For instance, the head of the figure of Jonah at the
end over the altar is thrown back in the design, but owing to the
curvature in the architecture is actually more forward than the feet.
Then again, the prophets and sybils seated round the ceiling, which are
perhaps the grandest figures in the whole range of art, would be 18 ft.
high if they stood up; these, too, are not on a flat surface, so that it
required great knowledge to give them their right effect.</p>

<p>Of course, much depends upon the distance we view these statues or
paintings from. In interiors, such as churches, halls, galleries,
&amp;c., we can make a fair calculation, such as the length of the nave,
if the picture is an altar-piece&mdash;or say, half the length; so also
with statuary in niches, friezes, and other architectural ornaments. The
nearer we are to them, and the more we have to look up, the larger will
the upper figures have to be; but if these are on the outside of a
building that can be looked at from a long distance, then it is better
not to have too great a difference.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
<!--png 075-->
For the farther we recede the more equal are the angles at which we view
the objects at their different stages, so that in each case we may have
to deal with, we must consider the conditions attending&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>These remarks apply also to architecture in a great measure.
Buildings that can only be seen from the street below, as pictures in a
narrow gallery, require a different treatment from those out in the
open, that are to be looked at from a distance. In the former case the
same treatment as the Campanile at Florence is in some cases desirable,
but all must depend upon the taste and judgement of the architect in
such matters. All I venture to do here is to call attention to the
subject, which seems as a rule to be ignored, or not to be considered of
importance. Hence the many mistakes in our buildings, and the
unsatisfactory and mean look of some of our public monuments.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Of Pictures that are Painted according to the
Position they are to Occupy</h5>


<p>In this double-page illustration of the wall of a picture-gallery,
I&nbsp;have, as it were, hung the pictures in accordance with the style
in which they are painted and the perspective adopted by their painters.
It will be seen that those placed on the line level with the eye have
their horizon lines fairly high up, and are not suited to be placed any
higher. The Giorgione in the centre, the Monna Lisa to the right, and
the Velasquez and Watteau to the left, are all pictures that fit that
position; whereas the grander compositions above them are so designed,
and are so large in conception, that we gain in looking up to them.</p>

<p>Note how grandly the young prince on his pony, by Velasquez, tells
out against the sky, with its low horizon and strong contrast of light
and dark; nor does it lose a bit by being placed where it is, over the
smaller pictures.</p>

<p>The Rembrandt, on the opposite side, with its burgomasters in black
hats and coats and white collars, is evidently intended and painted for
a raised position, and to be looked up to, which is evident from the
perspective of the table. The grand Titian in
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
<!--png 076-->
the centre, an altar-piece in one of the churches in Venice (here
reversed), is also painted to suit its elevated position, with low
horizon and figures telling boldly against the sky. Those placed low
down are modern French pictures, with the horizon high up and almost
above their frames, but placed on the ground they fit into the general
harmony of the arrangement.</p>

<p>It seems to me it is well, both for those who paint and for those who
hang pictures, that this subject should be taken into consideration. For
it must be seen by this illustration that a bigger style is adopted by
the artists who paint for high places in palaces or churches than by
those who produce smaller easel-pictures intended to be seen close.
Unfortunately, at our picture exhibitions, we see too often that nearly
all the works, whether on large or small canvases, are painted for the
line, and that those which happen to get high up look as if they were
toppling over, because they have such a high horizontal line; and
instead of the figures telling against the sky, as in this picture of
the &lsquo;Infant&rsquo; by Velasquez, the Reynolds, and the fat man
treading on a flag, we have fields or sea or distant landscape almost to
the top of the frame, and all, so methinks, because the perspective is
not sufficiently considered.</p>


<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Whilst on this subject, I&nbsp;may note that the
painter in his large decorative work often had difficulties to contend
with, which arose from the form of the building or the shape of the wall
on which he had to place his frescoes. Painting on the ceiling was no
easy task, and Michelangelo, in a humorous sonnet addressed to Giovanni
da Pistoya, gives a burlesque portrait of himself while he was painting
the Sistine Chapel:&mdash;</p>

At present that difficulty is got over by using large strong canvas, on
which the picture can be painted in the studio and afterwards placed on
the wall.</p>

<p>However, the other difficulty of form has to be got over also.
A&nbsp;great portion of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, and notably
the prophets and sibyls, are painted on a curved surface, in which case
a similar method to that explained by Leonardo da Vinci has to be
adopted.</p>

<p>In Chapter CCCI he shows us how to draw a figure twenty-four braccia

<p>The vanishing scale, which we shall find of infinite use in our
perspective, is founded on the facts explained in Rule 10. We there find
that all horizontals in the same plane, which are drawn to the same
point on the horizon, are perspectively parallel to each other, so that
if we measure a certain height or width on the picture plane, and then
from each extremity draw lines to any convenient point on the horizon,
then all the perpendiculars drawn between these lines will be
perspectively equal, however much they may appear to vary in length.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that in this figure (76) <span class =

represent 5&nbsp;feet. Then in the first case all the verticals, as

represent 5&nbsp;feet, and in the second case all the horizontals
<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, drawn between AÂ·O and BÂ·O also
represent 5&nbsp;feet each. So that by the aid of this scale we can give
the exact perspective height and width of any object in the picture,

<p>In an extended view or landscape seen from a height, we have to
consider the perspective plane as in a great measure lying above it,
reaching from the base of the picture to the horizon; but of course
pierced here and there by trees, mountains, buildings, &amp;c. As a rule
in such cases, we copy our perspective from nature, and do not trouble
ourselves much about mathematical rules. It is as well, however, to know
them, so that we may feel sure we are right, as this gives certainty to
our touch and enables us to work with freedom. Nor must we, when
painting from nature, forget to take into account the effects of
atmosphere and the various tones of the different planes of distance,
for this makes much of the difference between a good picture and a bad
one; being a more subtle quality, it requires a keener artistic sense to
discover and depict it. (See <a href = "#fig95">Figs. 95</a> and <a href

<p>If the landscape painter wishes to test his knowledge of perspective,
let him dissect and work out one of Turner's pictures, or better still,
put his own sketch from nature to the same test.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that too near a point of distance is

we can find that same point if we take half the base and draw a line
from Â½ base to Â½ distance. But even this Â½ distance-point does not come
inside the picture, so we take a fourth of the base and a fourth of the
distance and draw a line from Â¼ base to Â¼ distance. We shall find that
it passes precisely through the same point <i>o</i> as the other lines
<i>a</i><span class = "smallroman">D</span>, &amp;c. We are thus able to
find the required point <i>o</i> without going outside the picture.</p>

<p>Of course we could in the same way take an 8th or even a 16th
distance, but the great use of this reduced distance, in addition to the
above, is that it enables us to measure any depth into the picture with
the greatest ease.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the next figure that without having to extend the
base, as is usually done, we can multiply that base to any amount by
making use of these reduced distances on the horizontal line. This is
quite a new method of proceeding, and it will be seen is mathematically
correct.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">How to Measure Long Distances such as a Mile or
Upwards</h5>


<p>The wonderful effect of distance in Turner's pictures is not to be
achieved by mere measurement, and indeed can only be properly done by
studying Nature and drawing her perspective as she presents it to us. At
the same time it is useful to be able to test and to set out distances
in arranging a composition. This latter, if neglected, often leads to
great difficulties and sometimes to repainting.</p>

<p>To show the method of measuring very long distances we have to work
with a very small scale to the foot, and in Fig. 94 I have divided the
base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> into eleven parts, each part
representing 10 feet. First draw <span class = "smallroman">AS</span>
and <span class = "smallroman">BS</span> to point of sight.
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
<!--png 102-->
From <span class = "smallroman">A</span> draw <span class =
"smallroman">AD</span> to Â¼ distance, and we obtain at 440 on line <span
class = "smallroman">BS</span> four times the length of <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, or 110 feet Ã—&nbsp;4 = 440 feet. Again, taking
the whole base and drawing a line from S to 8th distance we obtain eight
times 110 feet or 880 feet. If now we use the 16th distance we get
sixteen times 110 feet, or 1,760 feet, one-third of a mile; by repeating
this process, but by using the base at 1,760, which is the same length
in perspective as <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>, we obtain 3,520
feet, and then again using the base at 3,520 and proceeding in the same
way we obtain 5,280 feet, or one mile to the archway. The flags show
their heights at their respective distances from the base. By the scale
at the side of the picture, <span class = "smallroman">BO</span>, we can
measure any height above or any depth below the perspective plane.</p>

<p>An extended view is generally taken from an elevated position, so
that the principal part of the landscape lies beneath the perspective
plane, as already noted, and we shall presently treat of objects and
figures on uneven ground. In the previous figure is shown how we can
measure heights and depths to any extent. But when we turn to a drawing
by Turner, such as the &lsquo;View from Richmond Hill&rsquo;, we feel
that the only way to accomplish such perspective as this, is to go and
draw it from nature, and even then to use our judgement, as he did, as
to how much we may emphasize or even exaggerate certain features.</p>

<p>The three figures to the right marked <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>b</i>
(Fig. 96) are on level ground, and we measure them by the vanishing
scale <i>a</i><span class = "smallroman">S</span>, <i>b</i><span class =

are on an inclined plane, the vanishing point of which is <span class =

vanishing scale <i>aÂ·</i><span class = "smallroman">SÂ·</span>,
<i>bÂ·</i><span class = "smallroman">SÂ·</span>, by which we measure the
figures on that incline in the same way as on the level plane. It will
be seen that if a horizontal line is drawn from the foot of one of these
figures, say <span class = "smallroman">G</span>, to point <span class =
"smallroman">O</span> on the edge of the incline, then dropped
vertically to <i>oÂ·</i>, then again carried on to <i>oÂ·Â·</i> where the
other figure <i>g</i> is, we find it is the same height and also that
the other vanishing scale is the same width at that distance, so that we
can work from either one or the other. In the event of the rising ground
being uneven we can make use of the scale on the level plane.</p>

<p>In the previous method we have drawn our squares by means of a

then by means of the perspective drawing thus obtained, finding our
vanishing and measuring points. In this method we proceed in exactly the
opposite way, setting out our points first, and drawing the square (or
other figure) afterwards.</p>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>Having drawn the horizontal and base lines, and fixed upon the
position of the point of sight, we next mark the position of the
spectator by dropping a perpendicular, <span class =
"smallcaps">S&nbsp;ST</span>, from that point of sight, making it the
same length as the distance we suppose the spectator to be from the
picture, and thus we make <span class = "smallroman">ST</span> the
station-point.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
<!--png 129-->
To understand this figure we must first look upon it as a ground-plan or
bird&rsquo;s-eye view, the line <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup><span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup> or horizon line representing the
picture seen edgeways, because of course the station-point cannot be in
the picture itself, but a certain distance in front of it. The angle at
<span class = "smallroman">ST</span>, that is the angle which decides
the positions of the two vanishing points <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup>, <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup>, is always a right angle, and the two
remaining angles on that side of the line, called the directing line,
are together equal to a right angle or 90Â°. So that in fixing upon the
angle at which the square or other figure is to be placed, we say
&lsquo;let it be 60Â° and 30Â°, or 70Â° and 20Â°&rsquo;, &amp;c. Having
decided upon the station-point and the angle at which the square is to
be placed, draw <span class = "smallroman">TV</span><sup>1</sup> and
<span class = "smallroman">TV</span><sup>2</sup>, till they cut the
horizon at <span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup> and <span
class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup>. These are the two vanishing
points to which the sides of the figure are respectively drawn. But we
still want the measuring points for these two vanishing lines. We
therefore take first, <span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup> as
centre and <span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup><span class =
"smallroman">T</span> as radius, and describe arc of circle till it cuts
the horizon in <span class = "smallroman">M</span><sup>1</sup>, which is
the measuring point for all lines drawn to <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup>. Then with radius <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup><span class = "smallroman">T</span>
describe arc from centre <span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup>
till it cuts the horizon in <span class =
"smallroman">M</span><sup>2</sup>, which is the measuring point for all
vanishing lines drawn to <span class =
"smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup>. We have now set out our points. Let
us proceed to draw the square <span class =
"smallroman">A</span><i>bcd</i>. From <span class =
"smallroman">A</span>, the nearest angle (in this instance touching the
base line), measure on each side of it the equal lengths <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> and <span class = "smallroman">AE</span>, which
represent the width or side of the square. Draw <span class =
"smallroman">EM</span><sup>2</sup> and <span class =
"smallroman">BM</span><sup>1</sup> from the two measuring points, which
give us, by their intersections with the vanishing lines <span class =
"smallroman">AV</span><sup>1</sup> and <span class =
"smallroman">AV</span><sup>2</sup>, the perspective lengths of the sides
of the square <span class = "smallroman">A</span><i>bcd</i>. Join
<i>b</i> and <span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>1</sup> and
<i>d</i><span class = "smallroman">V</span><sup>2</sup>, which intersect
each other at <span class = "smallroman">C</span>, then <span class =
"smallroman">A</span><i>dcb</i> is the square required.</p>

<p>This method, which is easy when you know it, has certain drawbacks,
the chief one being that if we require a long-distance point, and a
small angle, such as 10Â° on one side, and 80Â° on the other, then the
size of the diagram becomes so large that it has to be carried out on
the floor of the studio with long strings, &amp;c., which is a very
clumsy and unscientific way of setting to work. The architects in such
cases make use of the centrolinead, a&nbsp;clever mechanical contrivance
for getting over the difficulty of the far-off vanishing point, but by
the method I have shown you, and shall further illustrate, you will find
that you can dispense with
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
<!--png 130-->
all this trouble, and do all your perspective either inside the picture
or on a very small margin outside&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Perhaps another drawback to this method is that it is not
self-evident, as in the former one, and being rather difficult to
explain, the student is apt to take it on trust, and not to trouble
about the reasons for its construction: but to show that it is equally
correct, I&nbsp;will draw the two methods in one figure.</p>

where these diagonals intersect the vanishing lines drawn in the

<span class = "smallroman">A</span><i>d</i>, <i>bc</i>, draw lines to
the other vanishing point <span class =

cover the floor with them; they will then serve to measure width of

<p>In order to see this drawing properly, the eye should be placed about

stand out like a stereoscopic picture, and appear as actual space, but
otherwise the perspective seems deformed, and the

distance, the point of distance should be at least twice as far off as
it is here, and this would mean altering all the other points and
sending them a long way out of the picture; this is why artists use
those long strings referred to above. I&nbsp;would however, advise them
to make their perspective drawing on a small scale, and then square it
up to the size of the canvas.</p>

<p>To find the centre of a square or other rectangular figure we have
but to draw its two diagonals, and their intersection will give us the

shown how a diagonal, drawn from one angle of a square <span class =

<p>Let it be observed that the great advantage of this method is, that

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;As we have founded many of these figures on a

of a geometrical plan, as in the first method, or the more cumbersome

<p>Here, for instance, are two aspects of the same thing: the
geometrical square <span class = "smallroman">A</span>, which is facing
us, and the perspective square <span class = "smallroman">B</span>,
which we suppose to lie flat on the table, or rather on the perspective
plane. Line <span class = "smallroman">AÂ·CÂ·</span> is the perspective of
line <span class = "smallroman">AC</span>. On the geometrical square we
can make what measurements we please with the compasses, but on the
perspective square <span class = "smallroman">BÂ·</span> the only line we
can actually measure is the base line. In both figures this base line is
the same length. Suppose we want to find the

way we can find the perspective of any number of points on any side of

<p>In the same manner we can draw a cubic figure (Fig. 154)&mdash;a box,

<p>The student can examine these figures for himself, and will

standing on its base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>. We wish to
place a projection of this figure at a certain distance and at a given
angle in space. First of all we transfer it to the side of the cube,
where it is seen in perspective, whilst at its side is another
perspective square lying flat, on which we have to stand our figure. By
means of the diagonal of this flat square, horizontals from figure on
side of cube, and lines drawn from point of sight (as already
explained), we obtain the direction of base line <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, and also by means of lines <i>aaÂ·</i> and
<i>bbÂ·</i> we obtain the two points in space <i>aÂ·bÂ·</i>. Join <span
class = "smallroman">A</span><i>aÂ·</i>, <i>aÂ·bÂ·</i> and <span class =

<h5 class = "smallcaps">To Draw an Oblique Square in Another Oblique
Square without Using Vanishing Points</h5>


<p>It is not often that both vanishing points are inaccessible, still it
is well to know how to proceed when this is the case. We first draw the
square <span class = "smallroman">ABCD</span> inside the parallel
square, as in previous figures. To draw the smaller square <span class =
"smallroman">K</span> we simply draw a smaller parallel square <i>h h h
h</i>, and within that, guided by the intersections of the diagonals
therewith, we obtain the four points through which to draw square <span
class = "smallroman">K</span>. To raise a solid figure on these squares
we can make use of the vanishing scales as
<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<!--png 156-->
shown on each side of the figure, thus obtaining the upper square
1&nbsp;2 3&nbsp;4, then by means of the diagonal 1&nbsp;3 and 2&nbsp;4
and verticals raised from each corner of square <span class =
"smallroman">K</span> to meet them we obtain the smaller upper square
corresponding to <span class = "smallroman">K</span>.</p>

<p>It might be said that all this can be done by using the two vanishing
points in the usual way. In the first place, if they were as far off as
required for this figure we could not get them into a page unless it
were three or four times the width of this one, and to use shorter
distances results in distortion, so that the real use of this system is
that we can make our figures look quite natural and with much less
trouble than by the other method.</p>

<p>Let us take this example from a sketch made at Honfleur (Fig. 163),
and in which my eye was my only guide, but it stands the test of the
rule. First of all note that line <span class = "smallroman">HH</span>,
drawn from one side of the picture to the other, is the horizontal line;
below that is a wall and a pavement marked <i>a</i><span class =
"smallroman">V</span>, also going from one side of the picture to the
other, and being lower down at <i>a</i> than at <span class =
"smallroman">V</span> it runs up as it were to meet the horizon at some
distant point. In order to form our scale I take first the length of
<span class = "smallroman">H</span><i>a</i>, and measure it above and
below the horizon, along the side to our left as many times as required,
in this case four or five. I&nbsp;now take the length <span class =
"smallroman">HV</span> on the right side of the picture and measure it
above and below the horizon, as in the other case; and then from these
divisions obtain dotted lines crossing the picture from one side to the
other which must all meet at some distant point on the horizon. These
act as guiding lines, and are sufficient to give us the direction of any
vanishing lines going to the same point. For those that go in the
opposite direction we proceed in the same way, as from <i>b</i> on the
right to <span class = "smallroman">VÂ·</span> on the left. They are here
put in faintly, so as not to interfere with the drawing. In the sketch
of Toledo (Fig. 164) the same thing is shown by double lines on each
side to separate the two sets of lines, and to make the principle more
evident.</p>

<p>If we inscribe a circle in a square we find that it touches that
square at four points which are in the middle of each side, as at <i>a b
c d</i>. It will also intersect the two diagonals at the four points
<i>o</i> (Fig. 165). If, then, we put this square and its diagonals,
&amp;c., into perspective we shall have eight guiding points through
which to trace the required circle, as shown in Fig. 166, which has the
same base as Fig. 165.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">The Circle in Perspective a True Ellipse</h5>


<p>Although the circle drawn through certain points must be a freehand
drawing, which requires a little practice to make it true, it is
sufficient for ordinary purposes and on a small scale, but to be
mathematically true it must be an ellipse. We will first draw an ellipse
(Fig. 167). Let <i>ee</i> be its long, or transverse, diameter, and
<i>db</i> its short or conjugate diameter. Now take half of the long
diameter <i>e</i><span class = "smallroman">E</span>, and from point
<i>d</i> with <i>c</i><span class = "smallroman">E</span> for radius
mark on <i>ee</i> the two points <i>ff</i>, which are the foci of the
ellipse. At each focus fix a pin, then make a loop of fine string that
does not stretch and of such a length that when drawn out the double
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
<!--png 162-->
thread will reach from <i>f</i> to <i>e</i>. Now place this double
thread round the two pins at the foci <i>ffÂ·</i> and distend it with the
pencil point until it forms triangle <i>fdfÂ·</i>, then push the pencil
along and right round the two foci, which being guided by the thread
will draw the curve, which is a true ellipse, and will pass through the
eight points indicated in our first figure. This will be a sufficient
proof that the circle in perspective and the ellipse are identical
curves. We must also remember that the ellipse is an oblique projection
of a circle, or an oblique section of a cone. The difference between the
two figures consists in their centres not being in the same place, that
of the perspective circle being at <i>c</i>, higher up than <i>e</i> the
centre of the ellipse. The latter being a geometrical figure, its long
diameter is exactly in the centre of the figure, whereas the centre
<i>c</i> and the diameter of the perspective are at the intersection of
the diagonals of the perspective square in which it is inscribed.</p>

<p>In order to show that the ellipse drawn by a loop as in the previous
figure is also a circle in perspective we must reconstruct around it the
square and its eight points by means of which it was drawn in the first
instance. We start with nothing but
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
<!--png 163-->
the ellipse itself. We have to find the points of sight and distance,
the base, &amp;c. Let us start with base <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, a&nbsp;horizontal tangent to the curve extending
beyond it on either side. From <span class = "smallroman">A</span> and
<span class = "smallroman">B</span> draw two other tangents so that they
shall touch the curve at points such as <span class =
"smallroman">TTÂ·</span> a little above the transverse diameter and on a
level with each other. Produce these tangents till they meet at point
<span class = "smallroman">S</span>, which will be the point of sight.
Through this point draw horizontal line <span class =
"smallroman">H</span>. Now draw tangent <span class =
"smallroman">CD</span> parallel to <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>.
Draw diagonal <span class = "smallroman">AD</span> till it cuts the
horizon at the point of distance, this will cut through diameter of
circle at its centre, and so proceed to find the eight points through
which the perspective circle passes, when it will be found that they all
lie on the ellipse we have drawn with the loop, showing that the two
curves are identical although their centres are distinct.</p>

<p>Divide base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> into four equal
parts. At <span class = "smallroman">B</span> drop perpendicular <span
class = "smallroman">B</span><i>n</i>, making <span class =
"smallroman">B</span><i>n</i> equal to <span class =
"smallroman">B</span><i>m</i>, or one-fourth of base. Join <i>mn</i> and
transfer this measurement to each side of <i>d</i> on base line; that
is, make <i>df</i> and <i>dfÂ·</i> equal to <i>mn</i>. Draw <i>f</i><span

"smallroman">S</span>, and the intersections of these lines with the
diagonals of square will give us the four points <i>o o

<p>The reason of this is that <i>ffÂ·</i> is the measurement on the base
<span class = "smallroman">AB</span> of another square <i>o o o o</i>
which is exactly half of the outer square. For if we inscribe a circle
in a square and then inscribe a second square in that circle, this
second square will be exactly half the area of the larger one; for its
side will be equal to half the diagonal of the larger square, as can be
seen by studying

<i>h</i> in two equal parts, <span class =

"smallroman">B</span>. It will be seen that <i>h</i><span class =

diagonal, so if we measure <i>mn</i> on each side of <span class =
"smallroman">D</span> we get <i>ffÂ·</i> equal to <span class =

<i>fÂ·f</i> passing through the diagonals we get the four points <i>o o o

geometry we can see at a glance by Fig. 172, where we have simply turned
the square <i>o o o o</i> on its centre so that its angles touch the
sides of the outer square, that it is exactly half of square <span class

<h5 class = "smallcaps">How to Draw Columns Standing in a Circle</h5>


<p>In Fig. 195 are sixteen cylinders or columns standing in a circle.
First draw the circle on the ground, then divide it into sixteen equal
parts, and let each division be the centre of the circle on which to
raise the column. The question is how to make each one the right width
in accordance with its position, for it is evident that a near column
must appear wider than the opposite one. On the right of the figure is
the vertical scale <span class = "smallroman">A</span>, which gives the
heights of the columns, and at its foot is a horizontal scale, or a
scale of widths <span class = "smallroman">B</span>. Now, according to
the line on which the column stands, we find its apparent width marked
on the scale. Thus take the small square and circle at 15, without its
column, or the broken column at 16; and note that on each side of its
centre <span class = "smallroman">O</span> I have measured <i>oa</i>,
<i>ob</i>, equal to spaces marked 3 on the same horizontal in the scale
<span class = "smallroman">B</span>. Through these points <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> I have drawn lines towards point of sight <span class =
"smallroman">S</span>. Through their intersections with diagonal
<i>e</i>, which is directed to point of distance, draw the farther and
nearer sides of the square in which to describe the circle and the
cylinder or column thereon. I&nbsp;have made all the squares thus
obtained in parallel perspective, but they do not represent the bases of
columns arranged in circles, which should converge towards the centre,
and I believe in some cases are modified in form to suit that
design.</p>

Architects</h5>


<p>The architects first draw a plan and elevation of the building to be
put into perspective. Having placed the plan at the required angle to
the picture plane, they fix upon the point of sight, and the distance
from which the drawing is to be viewed. They then draw a line <span
class = "smallroman">SP</span> at right angles to the picture plane
<span class = "smallroman">VVÂ·</span>, which represents that distance so
that <span class = "smallroman">P</span> is the station-point. The eye
is generally considered to be the station-point, but when lines are
drawn to that point from the ground-plan, the station-point
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
<!--png 191-->
is placed on the ground, and is in fact the trace or projection exactly
under the point at which the eye is placed. From this station-point
<span class = "smallroman">P</span>, draw lines <span class =
"smallroman">PV</span> and <span class = "smallroman">PVÂ·</span>
parallel to the two sides of the plan <i>ba</i> and <i>ad</i> (which
will be at right angles to each other), and produce them to the horizon,
which they will touch at points <span class = "smallroman">V</span> and
<span class = "smallroman">VÂ·</span>. These points thus obtained will be
the two vanishing points.</p>

<p>The next operation is to draw lines from the principal points of the
plan to the station-point <span class = "smallroman">P</span>, such as
<i>b</i><span class = "smallroman">P</span>, <i>c</i><span class =
"smallroman">P</span>, <i>d</i><span class = "smallroman">P</span>,
&amp;c., and where these lines intersect the picture plane (<span class
= "smallroman">VVÂ·</span> here represents it as well as the horizon),
drop perpendiculars <i>bÂ·</i><span class = "smallroman">B</span>,
<i>a</i><span class = "smallroman">A</span>, <i>dÂ·</i><span class =
"smallroman">D</span>, &amp;c., to meet the vanishing lines <span class
= "smallroman">AV</span>, <span class = "smallroman">AVÂ·</span>, which
will determine the points <span class = "smallroman">A</span>, <span
class = "smallroman">B</span>, <span class = "smallroman">C</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">D</span>, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., and also the
perspective lengths of the sides of the figure <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, <span class = "smallroman">AD</span>, and the
divisions <span class = "smallroman">B</span>, 1, 2, &amp;c. Taking the
height of the figure <span class = "smallroman">AE</span> from the
elevation, we measure it on <span class = "smallroman">A</span><i>a</i>;
as in this instance <span class = "smallroman">A</span> touches the
ground line, it may be used as a line of heights.</p>

<p>I have here placed the perspective drawing under the ground plan to

out, but the general practice is to find the required measurements as
here shown, to mark them on a straight edge of card or paper, and
transfer them to the paper on which the drawing is to be made.</p>

<p>This of course is the simplest form of a plan and elevation. It is
easy to see, however, that we could set out an elaborate building in the

drawing underneath the ground-plan, but transfer the measurements to
another sheet of paper as mentioned above.</p>

<p>To draw the geometrical figure of an octagon contained in a square,
take half of the diagonal of that square as radius, and from each corner
describe a quarter circle. At the eight points where they touch the
sides of the square, draw the eight sides of the octagon.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective take the base of the square <span class

(say <span class = "smallroman">B</span>) drop perpendicular <span class

half that diagonal, describe arc <span class = "smallroman">EOE</span>.

<h5 class = "smallcaps">A Pavement Composed of Hexagonal Tiles</h5>


<p>In drawing pavements, except in the cases of square tiles, it is
necessary to make a plan of the required design, as in this figure
composed of hexagons. First set out the hexagon as at <span class =
"smallroman">A</span>, then draw parallels 1&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;2, &amp;c.,
to mark the horizontal ends of the tiles and the intermediate lines
<i>oo</i>. Divide the base into the required number of parts, each equal
to one side of the hexagon, as 1,&nbsp;2, 3,&nbsp;4, &amp;c.; from these
draw perpendiculars as shown in the figure, and also the diagonals
passing through their intersections. Then mark with a strong line the
outlines of the hexagonals, shading some of them; but the figure
explains itself.</p>

<p>It is easy to put all these parallels, perpendiculars, and diagonals
into perspective, and then to draw the hexagons.</p>

<p>First draw the hexagon on <span class = "smallroman">AD</span> as in
the previous figure, dividing

<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>

<span class = "smallroman">AD</span> into four, &amp;c., set off right
and left spaces equal to these fourths, and from each division draw
lines to point of sight. Produce sides <i>me</i>, <i>nf</i> till they
touch the horizon in points <span class = "smallroman">V</span>, <span
class = "smallroman">VÂ·</span>; these will be the two vanishing points
for all the sides of the tiles that are receding from us. From each
division on base draw lines to each of these vanishing points, then draw
parallels through their intersections as shown on the figure. Having all
these guiding lines it will not be difficult to draw as many hexagons as
you please.</p>

<p>This is more difficult than the previous figure, as we only make use

<p>The pentagon is a figure with five equal sides, and if inscribed in a
circle will touch its circumference at five equidistant points. With any
convenient radius describe circle. From half this radius, marked&nbsp;1,
draw a line to apex, marked&nbsp;2. Again, with 1 as centre and 1&nbsp;2
as radius, describe arc 2&nbsp;3. Now with 2 as centre and 2&nbsp;3 as
radius describe arc 3&nbsp;4, which will cut the circumference at
point&nbsp;4. Then line 2&nbsp;4 will be one of the sides of the
pentagon, which we can measure round the circle and so produce the
required figure.</p>

<p>To put this pentagon into parallel perspective inscribe the circle in
which it is drawn in a square, and from its five angles
4,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;4, &amp;c., drop perpendiculars to base and number them
as in the figure. Then draw the perspective square (Fig. 217) and
transfer these measurements to its base. From these draw lines to point

the pentagon in the same way that we did the triangles and other
figures. Should it be required to place this

<p>Another way of drawing a pentagon (Fig. 220) is to draw an isosceles
triangle with an angle of 36Â° at its apex, and from centre of each side

the centre of the circle in which it is inscribed. From this centre and

<p>This enormous structure stands on a square base of over thirteen
acres, each side of which measures, or did measure, 764 feet. Its
original height was 480 feet, each side being an equilateral triangle.
Let us see how we can draw this gigantic mass on our little sheet of
paper.</p>

<p>In the first place, to take it all in at one view we must put it very
far back, and in the second the horizon must be so low down that we
cannot draw the square base of thirteen acres on the perspective plane,
that is on the ground, so we must draw it in the air, and also to a very
small scale.</p>

<p>Divide the base <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> into ten equal
parts, and suppose each of these parts to measure 10 feet, <span class =

picture near the side, in order that we may get a long line of distance,
<span class = "smallroman">S</span> Â½ <span class =
"smallroman">D</span>; but even this line is only half the distance we
require. Let us therefore take the 16th distance, as shown in our
previous illustration of the lighthouse (Fig. 92), which enables us to
measure sixteen times the length of base <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span>, or 1,600 feet. The base <i>ef</i> of the pyramid
is 1,600 feet from the base line of the picture, and is, according to
our 10-foot scale, 764 feet long.</p>

<p>The next thing to consider is the height of the pyramid. We make a
scale to the right of the picture measuring 50 feet from <span class =
"smallroman">B</span> to 50 at point where <span class =
"smallroman">BP</span> intersects base of pyramid, raise perpendicular
<span class = "smallroman">CG</span> and thereon measure 480 feet. As we
cannot obtain a palpable square on the ground, let us draw one 480 feet
above the ground. From <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> raise verticals
<i>e</i><span class = "smallroman">M</span> and <i>f</i><span class =
"smallroman">N</span>, making them equal to perpendicular <span class =
"smallroman">G</span>, and draw line <span class =
"smallroman">MN</span>, which will be the same length as base, or 764
feet. On this line form square <span class = "smallroman">MNK</span>
parallel to the perspective plane, find its centre <span class =
"smallroman">OÂ·</span> by means of diagonals, and <span class =
"smallroman">OÂ·</span> will be the central height of the pyramid and
exactly over the centre of the base. From this point <span class =
"smallroman">OÂ·</span> draw sloping lines <span class =
"smallroman">OÂ·</span><i>f</i>, <span class =

measures 100 feet at a distance of 1,600 feet. We mark off seven of
these lengths, and an additional 64 feet by the scale, and so obtain the
required length. The position of the third corner of the base is found
by dropping a perpendicular from <span class = "smallroman">K</span>,
till it meets the line <i>e</i><span class = "smallroman">S</span>.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that the side of the pyramid that faces us,
although an equilateral triangle, does not appear so, as its top angle
is 382 feet farther off than its base owing to its leaning position.</p>

<p>To draw a sloping or hip-roof which falls back at each end we must

fall back at each end, namely the distance <span class =

<span class = "smallroman">A</span> draw horizontal <span class =

points <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> raise perpendiculars the height required
for the roof, and from these draw sloping lines to the corners of the
base. Join <i>ef</i>, that is, draw the top line of the roof, which
completes it. Fig. 231 shows a plan or bird's-eye view of the roof and
the diagonal <span class = "smallroman">AB</span> passing through centre
<span class = "smallroman">O</span>. But there are so many varieties of
roofs they would take almost a book to themselves to illustrate them,
especially the cottages and farm-buildings, barns, &amp;c., besides
churches, old mansions, and others. There is also such irregularity
about some of them that perspective rules, beyond those few here given,
are of very little use. So that the best thing for an artist to do is to
sketch them from the real whenever he has an opportunity.</p>

For an arcade or cloister (Fig. 232) first set up the outer frame <span

For round arches the height may be twice that of the base, varying to
one and a half. In Gothic arches the height may be about three times the
width, all of which proportions are chosen to suit the different
purposes and effects required. Divide the base <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> into the desired number of parts,
8,&nbsp;10,&nbsp;12, &amp;c., each part representing 1&nbsp;foot. (In
this case the base is 10 feet and the horizon 5&nbsp;feet.) Set out
floor by means of Â¼&nbsp;distance. Divide it into squares of
1&nbsp;foot, so that there will be 8&nbsp;feet between each column or
pilaster, supposing we make them to stand on a square foot. Draw the
first archway <span class = "smallroman">EKF</span> facing us, and its

<p>First draw perspective square <i>abcd</i>. Let <i>aeÂ·</i> be the

"smallroman">F</span> enclosed in the quadrangle <span class =
"smallroman">E</span><i>eÂ·fÂ·</i><span class = "smallroman">F</span>.
With centre <span class = "smallroman">O</span> describe the semicircle
and across it draw the diagonals <i>eÂ·</i><span class =

through <i>nn</i>, where these lines intersect the semicircle, draw
horizontal <span class = "smallroman">KK</span> and also <span class =

half-squares at the side are the same size in perspective as the one
facing us, and we carry out in them much the same operation; that is, we
draw the diagonals, find the point <span class = "smallroman">O</span>,
and the points <i>nn</i>, &amp;c., through which to draw our arches. See

<p>Draw square <span class = "smallroman">ABCD</span> in parallel
perspective. Divide each side into four, and raise verticals from each
division. These verticals will mark the positions of the steps on each
wall, four in number. From centre <span class = "smallroman">O</span>
raise vertical <span class = "smallroman">OP</span>, around which the
steps are to wind. Let <span class = "smallroman">AF</span> be the
height of each step. Form scale <span class = "smallroman">AB</span>,
which will give the height of each step according to its position. Thus
at <i>mn</i> we find the height at the centre of the square, so if we
transfer this measurement to the central line <span class =
"smallroman">OP</span> and repeat it upwards, say to fourteen, then we
have the height of each step on the line where they all meet. Starting
then with the first on the right, draw the rectangle <i>g</i><span class
= "smallroman">D</span>1<i>f</i>, the height of <span class =
"smallroman">AF</span>, then draw to the central line <i>go</i>,
<i>f</i>1, and 1&nbsp;1, and thus complete the first step. On <span
class = "smallroman">DE</span>, measure heights equal to <span class =
"smallroman">D</span>&nbsp;1. Draw 2&nbsp;2 towards central line, and
2<i>n</i> towards point of sight till it meets the second vertical
<i>n</i><span class = "smallroman">K</span>. Then draw <i>n</i>2 to
centre, and so complete the second step. From 3 draw 3<i>a</i> to third
vertical, from 4 to fourth, and so on, thus obtaining the height of each
ascending step on the wall to the right, completing them in the same way
as numbers 1 and&nbsp;2, when we come to the sixth step, the other end
of which is against the wall opposite to us. Steps 6,&nbsp;7, 8,&nbsp;9
are all on this wall, and are therefore equal in height all along, as
they are equally distant. Step 10 is turned towards us, and abuts on the
wall to our left; its measurement is taken on the scale <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> just underneath it, and on the same line to which
it is drawn. Step 11 is just over the centre of base <i>mo</i>, and is
therefore parallel to it, and its height is <i>mn</i>. The widths of
steps 12 and 13 seem gradually to increase as they come towards us, and
as they rise above the horizon we begin to see underneath them. Steps
13, 14, 15, 16 are against the wall on this side of the picture, which
we may suppose has been removed to show the working of the drawing, or
they might be an open flight as we sometimes see in shops and galleries,
although in that case they are generally enclosed in a cylindrical
shaft.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Of the Cylindrical Picture or Diorama</h5>


<p>Although illusion is by no means the highest form of art, there is no
picture painted on a flat surface that gives such a wonderful appearance
of truth as that painted on a cylindrical canvas, such as those
panoramas of &lsquo;Paris during the Siege&rsquo;, exhibited some years
ago; &lsquo;The Battle of Trafalgar&rsquo;, only lately shown at Earl's
Court; and many others. In these pictures the spectator is in the centre
of a cylinder, and although he turns round to look at the scene the
point of sight is always in front of him, or nearly so. I&nbsp;believe
on the canvas these points are from 12 to 16 feet apart.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<a name = "fig260" id = "fig260"> </a>

Fig. 260.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
<!--png 248-->
The reason of this look of truth may be explained thus. If we place
three globes of equal size in a straight line, and trace their apparent
widths on to a straight transparent plane, those at the sides, as
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, will appear much wider than the centre one at
<i>c</i>. Whereas, if we trace them on a semicircular glass they will
appear very nearly equal and, of the three, the central one <i>c</i>
will be rather the largest, as may be seen by this figure.</p>

<p>We must remember that, in the first case, when we are looking at a
globe or a circle, the visual rays form a cone, with a globe at its
base. If these three cones are intersected by a straight glass <span
class = "smallroman">GG</span>, and looked at from point <span class =
"smallroman">S</span>, the intersection of <span class =
"smallroman">C</span> will be a circle, as the cone is cut straight
across. The other two being intersected at an angle, will each be an
ellipse. At the same time, if we look at them from the station point,
with one eye only, then the three globes (or tracings of them) will
appear equal and perfectly round.</p>

<p>Of course the cylindrical canvas is necessary for panoramas; but we
have, as a rule, to paint our pictures and wall-decorations on flat
surfaces, and therefore must adapt our work to these conditions.</p>

<p>In all cases the artist must exercise his own judgement both in the
arrangement of his design and the execution of the work, for there is
perspective even in the touch&mdash;a painting to be looked at from a
distance requires a bold and broad handling; in small cabinet pictures
that we live with in our own rooms we look for the exquisite workmanship
of the best masters.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">The Perspective of Cast Shadows</h5>


<p>There is a pretty story of two lovers which is sometimes told as the
origin of art; at all events, I&nbsp;may tell it here as the origin of
sciagraphy. A&nbsp;young shepherd was in love with the daughter of a
potter, but it so happened that they had to part, and were passing their
last evening together, when the girl, seeing the shadow of her lover's
profile cast from a lamp on to some wet plaster or on the wall, took a
metal point, perhaps some sort of iron needle, and traced the outline of
the face she loved on to the plaster, following carefully the outline of
the features, being naturally anxious to make it as like as possible.
The old potter, the father of the girl, was so struck with it that he
began to ornament his wares by similar devices, which gave them
increased value by the novelty and beauty thus imparted to them.</p>

<p>Here then we have a very good illustration of our present subject and
its three elements. First, the light shining on the wall; second, the
wall or the plane of projection, or plane of shade; and third, the
intervening object, which receives as much light on itself as it
deprives the wall of. So that the dark portion thus caused on the plane
of shade is the cast shadow of the intervening object.</p>

<p>We have to consider two sorts of shadows: those cast by a luminary a
long way off, such as the sun; and those cast by artificial light, such
as a lamp or candle, which is more or less close to the object. In the
first case there is no perceptible divergence of rays, and the outlines
of the sides of the shadows of regular objects, as cubes, posts,
&amp;c., will be parallel. In the second case, the rays diverge
according to the nearness of the light, and consequently the lines of
the shadows, instead of being parallel, are spread out.</p>

<p>Fig. 263 shows the shadows cast by a candle or lamp, where the rays
diverge from the point of light to meet corresponding diverging lines
which start from the foot of the luminary on the ground.</p>

</p>

<p class = "caption smallcaps">
Fig. 263.</p>

<p>The simple principle of cast shadows is that the rays coming from the
point of light or luminary pass over the top of the intervening object
which casts the shadow on to the plane of shade to meet the horizontal
trace of those rays on that plane, or the
<span class = "pagenum">231</span>
<a name = "page231" id = "page231"> </a>
<!--png 251-->
lines of light proceed from the point of light, and the lines of the
shadow are drawn from the foot or trace of the point of light.</p>

<p>Fig. 264 shows this in profile. Here the sun is on the same plane as
the picture, and the shadow is cast sideways.</p>

parallel, they are subject to the laws of perspective, and are therefore
drawn from their respective vanishing points.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Shadows Cast by the Sun</h5>


<p>Owing to the great distance of the sun, we have to consider the rays
of light proceeding from it as parallel, and therefore subject to the
same laws as other parallel lines in perspective, as already noted. And
for the same reason we have to place the foot of the luminary on the
horizon. It is important to remember this, as these two things make the
difference between shadows cast by the sun and those cast by artificial
light.</p>

<p>The sun has three principal positions in relation to the picture. In
the first case it is supposed to be in the same plane either to the
right or to the left, and in that case the shadows will be
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
<!--png 253-->
parallel with the base of the picture. In the second position it is on
the other side of it, or facing the spectator, when the shadows of
objects will be thrown forwards or towards him. In the third, the sun is
in front of the picture, and behind the spectator, so that the shadows
are thrown in the opposite direction, or towards the horizon, the
objects themselves being in full light.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">The Sun in the Same Plane as the Picture</h5>


<p>Besides being in the same plane, the sun in this figure is at an
angle of 45Â° to the horizon, consequently the shadows will be the same
length as the figures that cast them are high. Note that the shadow of
step No.&nbsp;1 is cast upon step No.&nbsp;2, and that of No.&nbsp;2 on
No.&nbsp;3, the top of each of these becoming a plane of shade.</p>

<p>Although we have said that the rays pass over the top of the object

pass underneath it; but the same principle holds good, that is, we draw
lines from the guiding points in the arch, 1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3, &amp;c.,

<p>We have seen that when the sun's altitude is at an angle of 45Â° the
shadows on the horizontal plane are the same length as the height of the
objects that cast them. Here (Fig. 270), the sun still being at 45Â°
altitude, although behind the picture, and consequently throwing the
shadow of <span class = "smallroman">B</span> forwards, that shadow must
be the same length as the height of cube <span class =
"smallroman">B</span>, which will be seen is the case, for the shadow
<span class = "smallroman">C</span> is a square in perspective.</p>

we must first find the distance of the spectator from the foot of the

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The sun being at 50Â° to the picture instead of
45Â°, is nearer the point of sight; at 90Â° it would be exactly opposite
the spectator, and so on. Again, the elevation being less (40Â° instead
of 45Â°) the shadow is longer. Owing to the changed position of the sun
two sides of the cube throw a shadow. Note also that the outlines of the
shadow, 1&nbsp;2, 2&nbsp;3, are drawn to the same vanishing points as
the cube itself.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to mark the angles each time we make a
drawing, as it must be seen we can place the luminary in any position
that suits our convenience.</p>

<p>As here we change the conditions we must also change our procedure.
An upright wall now becomes the plane of shade, therefore as the
principle of shadows must always remain the same we have to change the
relative positions of the luminary and the foot thereof.</p>

<p>At <span class = "smallroman">S</span> (point of sight) raise
vertical <span class = "smallroman">SFÂ·</span>, making it equal to
<i>f</i><span class = "smallroman">L</span>. <span class =

<p>We have but to turn this page half round and look at it from the

as we did on the horizontal plane. Fig. <span class =

already shown. The steps have their shadows partly on the wall and
partly on the horizontal plane, so that the shadows on the wall are

<p>When the sun is in front of the picture we have exactly the opposite
effect to that we have just been studying. The shadows, instead of
coming towards us, are retreating from us, and the objects throwing them
are in full light, consequently we have to reverse our treatment. Let us
suppose the sun to be placed
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
<!--png 262-->
above the horizon at <span class = "smallroman">LÂ·</span>, on the right
of the picture and behind the spectator (Fig. 276). If we transport the
length <span class = "smallroman">LÂ·</span><i>fÂ·</i> to the opposite
side and draw the vertical downwards from the horizon, as at <span class
= "smallroman">FL</span>, we can then suppose point <span class =
"smallroman">L</span> to be exactly opposite the sun, and if we make
that the vanishing point for the sun's rays we shall find that we obtain
precisely the same result. As in Fig. 277, if we wish to find the length
of <span class = "smallroman">C</span>, which we may suppose to be the
shadow of <span class = "smallroman">P</span>, we can either draw a line
from <span class = "smallroman">A</span> through <span class =

as in the cases of sun-shadows, but with

this difference, that whereas the foot of the luminary in this latter
case is supposed to be on the horizon an infinite distance away, the
foot in the case of a lamp or candle may be on the floor or on a table
close to us. First draw the table and chair, &amp;c. (Fig. 287), and let
<span class = "smallroman">L</span> be the luminary. For objects on the
table such as <span class = "smallroman">K</span> the foot will be at
<i>f</i> on the table. For the shadows on the floor, of the chair and

<p>Although the figures we have been drawing show the principles on
which sun-shadows are shaped, still there are so many more laws to be
considered in the great art of light and shade that it is better to
observe them in Nature herself or under the teaching of the real sun. In
the study of a kitchen and scullery in an old house in Toledo (Fig. 288)
we have an example of the many things to be considered besides the mere
shapes of shadows of regular forms. It will be seen that the light is
dispersed in all directions, and although there is a good deal of
half-shade there are scarcely any cast shadows except on the floor; but
the light on the white walls in the outside gallery is so reflected into
the cast shadows that they are extremely faint. The luminosity of this
part of the sketch is greatly enhanced by the contrast of the dark legs
of the bench and the shadows in the roof. The warm glow of all this
portion is contrasted by the grey door and its frame.</p>

<p>Note that the door itself is quite luminous, and lighted up by the
reflection of the sun from the tiled floor, so that the bars in the
upper part throw distinct shadows, besides the mystery of colour thus
introduced. The little window to the left, though not admitting much
direct sunlight, is evidence of the brilliant glare outside; for the
reflected light is very conspicuous on the

top and on the shutters on each side; indeed they cast distinct shadows
up and down, while some clear daylight from the blue sky is reflected on
the window-sill. As to the sink, the table, the wash-tubs, &amp;c.,
although they seem in strong light and shade they really receive little
or no direct light from a single point; but from the strong reflected
light re-reflected into them from the wall of the doorway. There are
many other things in such effects as this which the artist will observe,
and which can only be studied from real light and shade. Such is the
character of reflected light, varying according to the angle and
intensity of the luminary and a hundred other things. When we come to
study light in the open air we get into another region, and have to deal
with it accordingly, and yet we shall find that our sciagraphy will be a
help to us even in this bewilderment; for it will explain in a manner
the innumerable shapes of sun-shadows that we observe out of doors among
hills and dales, showing up their forms and structure; its play in the
woods and gardens, and its value among buildings, showing all their
juttings and abuttings, recesses, doorways, and all the other
architectural details. Nor must we forget light's most glorious display
of all on the sea and in the clouds and in the sunrises and the sunsets
down to the still and lovely moonlight.</p>

<p>These sun-shadows are useful in showing us the principle of light and
shade, and so also are the shadows cast by artificial light; but they
are only the beginning of that beautiful study, that exquisite art of
tone or <i>chiaro-oscuro</i>, which is infinite in its variety, is full
of the deepest mystery, and is the true poetry of art. For this the
student must go to Nature herself, must study her in all her moods from
early dawn to sunset, in the twilight and when night sets in. No
mathematical rules can help him, but only the thoughtful contemplation,
the silent watching, and the mental notes that he can make and commit to
memory, combining them with the sentiments to which they in turn give
rise. The <i>plein air</i>, or broad daylight effects, are but one item
of the great range of this ever-changing and deepening
mystery&mdash;from the hard reality to the soft blending of evening when
form almost disappears, even to the merging of the whole landscape, nay,
the whole world, into a dream&mdash;which is felt

rather than seen, but possesses a charm that almost defies the pencil of
the painter, and can only be expressed by the deep and sweet notes of
the poet and the musician. For love and reverence are necessary to
appreciate and to present&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>There is also much to learn about artificial light. For here, again,
the study is endless: from the glare of a hundred lights&mdash;electric
and otherwise&mdash;to the single lamp or candle. Indeed a whole volume
could be filled with illustrations of its effects. To those who aim at
producing intense brilliancy, refusing to acknowledge any limitations to
their capacity, a&nbsp;hundred or a thousand lights commend themselves;
and even though wild splashes of paint may sometimes be the result,
still the effort is praiseworthy. But those who prefer the mysterious
lighting of a Rembrandt will find, if they sit contemplating in a room
lit with one lamp only, that an endless depth of mystery surrounds them,
full of dark recesses peopled by fancy and sweet thought, whilst the
most beautiful gradations soften the forms without distorting them; and
at the same time he can detect the laws of this science of light and
shade a thousand times repeated and endless in its variety.</p>

<p>Reflections in still water can best be illustrated by placing some
simple object, such as a cube, on a looking-glass laid horizontally on a
table, or by studying plants, stones, banks, trees, &amp;c., reflected
in some quiet pond. It will then be seen that the reflection is the
counterpart of the object reversed, and having the same vanishing points
as the object itself.</p>

<p>Let us suppose <span class = "smallroman">R</span> (Fig. 289) to be

square <ins class = "correction" title = "upside-down R">[<span class =

in its reflection [<span class = "smallcaps">R</span>] it is hidden,

underneath portion of the arch reflected in the water, but we do not see
it in the actual object. However, these things are obvious. Note that
the reflected line must be equal in length to the actual one, or the
reflection of a square would not be a square, nor that of a semicircle a
semicircle. The apparent lengthening of reflections in water is owing to
the surface being broken by wavelets, which, leaping up near to us,
catch some of the image of the tree, or whatever it is, that it is
reflected.</p>

<p>We have seen that the reflected line must be equal to the original

<span class = "smallroman">M</span><i>a</i>. They are also at right
angles to <span class = "smallroman">MN</span>, the plane of reflection.
We will now draw the visual ray passing from <span class =

which is the reflection of <span class = "smallroman">A</span>; and just

<span class = "smallroman">O</span>, which is the point where the visual

We have now two triangles, <span class = "smallroman">OA</span><i>m</i>
and <span class = "smallroman">O</span><i>m</i><span class =
"smallroman">B</span>, which are right-angled triangles and equal,
therefore angle <i>a</i> equals angle <i>b</i>. But angle <i>b</i>

<p>In this sketch the four posts and other objects are represented
standing on a plane level or almost level with the water, in order to
show the working of our problem more clearly. It will be seen that the
post <span class = "smallroman">A</span> is on the brink of the
reflecting plane, and therefore is entirely reflected; <span class =
"smallroman">B</span> and <span class = "smallroman">C</span> being
farther back are only partially seen, whereas the reflection of <span
class = "smallroman">D</span> is not seen at all. I&nbsp;have made all
the posts the same height, but with regard to the houses, where the
length of the vertical lines varies, we obtain their reflections by
measuring from the points <i>oo</i> upwards and downwards as in the
previous figure.</p>

<p>Of course these reflections vary according to the position they are
viewed from; the lower we are down, the more do we see of the
reflections of distant objects, and vice versa. When the figures are on
a higher plane than the water, that is, above the plane of reflection,
we have to find their perspective position,
<span class = "pagenum">261</span>

and drop a perpendicular <span class = "smallroman">AO</span> (Fig. 293)
till it comes in contact with the plane of reflection, which we suppose
to run under the ground, then measure the same length downwards, as in
this figure of a girl on the top of the steps. Point <i>o</i> marks the
point of contact with the plane, and by measuring downwards to <i>aÂ·</i>
we get the length of her reflection, or as much as is seen of it. Note
the reflection of the steps and the sloping bank, and the application of
the inclined plane ascending and descending.</p>

<p>I had noticed that some of the figures in Titian&rsquo;s pictures
were only half life-size, and yet they looked natural; and one day,
thinking I would trace myself in an upright mirror, I&nbsp;stood at
arm&rsquo;s length from it and with a brush and Chinese white,
I&nbsp;made a rough outline of my face and figure, and when I measured
it I found that my drawing was exactly half as long and half as wide as
nature. I&nbsp;went closer to the glass, but the same outline fitted me.
Then I retreated several paces, and still the same outline surrounded
me. Although a little surprising at first, the reason is obvious. The
image in the glass retreats or advances exactly in the same measure as
the spectator.</p>

<p>Suppose him to represent one end of a parallelogram <i>eÂ·sÂ·</i>, and
his image <i>aÂ·bÂ·</i> to represent the other. The mirror <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> is a perpendicular half-way between them, the
diagonal <i>eÂ·bÂ·</i> is the visual ray
<span class = "pagenum">263</span>
<a name = "page263" id = "page263"> </a>
<!--png 283-->
passing from the eye of the spectator to the foot of his image, and is
the diagonal of a rectangle, therefore it cuts <span class =
"smallroman">AB</span> in the centre <i>o</i>, and <span class =
"smallroman">AO</span> represents <i>aÂ·bÂ·</i> to the spectator. This is
an experiment that any one may try for himself. Perhaps the above fact
may have something to do with the remarks I made about Titian at the
beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>Now suppose our mirror to be standing on a horizontal plane and on a
pivot, so that it can be inclined either way. Whatever angle the mirror
is to the plane the reflection of that plane in the mirror will be at
the same angle on the other side of it, so that if the mirror <span
class = "smallroman">OA</span> (Fig. 298) is at 45Â° to the plane <span
class = "smallroman">RR</span> then the
<span class = "pagenum">265</span>
<a name = "page265" id = "page265"> </a>
<!--png 285-->
reflection of that plane in the mirror will be 45Â° on the other side of
it, or at right angles, and the reflected plane will appear
perpendicular, as shown in Fig. 299, where we have a front view of a
mirror leaning forward at an angle of 45Â° and reflecting the square
<i>aob</i> with a cube standing upon it, only in the reflection the cube
appears to be projecting from an upright plane or wall.</p>

<p>If we increase the angle from 45Â° to 60Â°, then the reflection of the
plane and cube will lean backwards as shown in Fig. 300. If we place it
on a level with the original plane, the cube will be standing upright
twice the distance away. If the mirror is still farther tilted till it
makes an angle of 135Â° as at <span class = "smallroman">E</span> (Fig.
298), or 45Â° on the other side of the vertical <span class =
"smallroman">O</span><i>c</i>, then the plane and cube would disappear,
and objects exactly over that plane, such as the ceiling, would come
into view.</p>

<p>In Fig. 300 the mirror is at 60Â° to the plane <i>mn</i>, and the
plane itself at about 15Â° to the plane <i>an</i> (so that here we are
using angular perspective, <span class = "smallroman">V</span> being the
accessible vanishing point). The reflection of the plane and cube is
seen leaning back at an

An endless number of complicated problems could be invented of the
inclined mirror, but they would be mere puzzles calculated rather to
deter the student than to instruct him. What we chiefly have to bear in
mind is the simple principle of reflections. When a mirror is vertical
and placed at the end or side of a room it reflects that room and gives
the impression that we are in one double the size. If two mirrors are
placed opposite to each other at each end of a room they reflect and
reflect, so that we see an endless number of rooms.</p>

<p>Again, if we are sitting in a gallery of pictures with a hand mirror,
we can so turn and twist that mirror about that we can bring any picture
in front of us, whether it is behind us, at the side, or even on the
ceiling. Indeed, when one goes to those old palaces and churches where
pictures are painted on the ceiling, as in the Sistine Chapel or the
Louvre, or the palaces at Venice, it is not a bad plan to take a hand
mirror with us, so that we can see those elevated works of art in
comfort.</p>

<p>There are also many uses for the mirror in the studio, well known to
the artist. One is to look at one's own picture reversed, when faults
become more evident; and another, when the model is required to be at a
longer distance than the dimensions of the studio will admit, by drawing
his reflection in the glass we double the distance he is
from&nbsp;us.</p>

<p>The reason the mirror shows the fault of a work to which the eye has
become accustomed is that it doubles it. Thus if a line that should be
vertical is leaning to one side, in the mirror it will lean to the
other; so that if it is out of the perpendicular to the left, its
reflection will be out of the perpendicular to the right, making a
double divergence from one to the other.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Mental Perspective</h5>


<p>Before we part, I&nbsp;should like to say a word about mental
perspective, for we must remember that some see farther than others, and
some will endeavour to see even into the infinite. To see Nature in all
her vastness and magnificence, the thought must supplement and must
surpass the eye. It is this far-seeing that makes the great poet, the
great philosopher, and the great artist. Let the student bear this in
mind, for if he possesses this quality or even a share of it, it will
give immortality to his work.</p>

<p>To explain in detail the full meaning of this suggestion is beyond
the province of this book, but it may lead the student to think this
question out for himself in his solitary and imaginative moments, and
should, I&nbsp;think, give a charm and virtue to his work which he
should endeavour to make of value, not only to his own time but to the
generations that are to follow. Cultivate, therefore, this mental
perspective, without forgetting the solid foundation of the science I
have endeavoured to impart to you.</p>
